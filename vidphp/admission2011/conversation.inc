<p>Vidyalaya is proud to introduce two new classes for children: Conversational Hindi and Conversational Gujarati.  These courses will begin in September 2012 and will focus on language listening and speaking skills only. Reading and writing skills will not be addressed. </p>

<p>Enrollment is open from now until August 10, 2012. We will accept the first 15 students who show an interest in joining each class. The students must have successfully completed Level 2 (Novice Mid) at Vidyalaya or demonstrate equivalent proficiency in the respective language. These courses will be in place of our regular language classes which run from 10:00 am to 11:00 am. The students will also be required to attend the culture classes from 11:00 am to 11:45 am. </p>

<p>If you have any questions, please e-mail asmita@vidyalaya.us.  If you are interested in enrolling your child in one of these courses, please reply to spa@vidyalaya.us.</p>
