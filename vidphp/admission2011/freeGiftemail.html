<p>Vidyalya has a limited stock of T-Shirts that were distributed to all families last year. We are happy to offer it to all new students. To collect your free gift, please have the student bring a printout of this email to the administration desk at 9:20 am on December 16, 2012. The desk is located to your left when you are facing the stage in the cafetorium. We only have limited supply of some sizes so please come early to collect yours.</p>
