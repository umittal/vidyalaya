<p>Starting 2011-12 session, Vidyalaya increased the enrollment fee by $100 in anticipation of higher costs associated with moving to the High School.  Based on the actual realized revenues and expenses, we now project that the affairs of the school can be managed with a tuition of $400 for a family with one student enrolled and $500 for more than one student.  This new fee structure represents a decrease of $50 per family from current levels and will be retroactive to 2011-12 year.</p>
 
<p>Our objective is to have a stable fee structure that supports all our activities with varying enrollment. Vidyalaya continues to maintain strict fiscal discipline and the fee structure represents an increase of only $25 since 2010-11 for families that register early.  For your family, $==AMOUNT== is due for refund and you should receive the check from our bank within next 8 weeks.</p>
 
<p>We encourage you to verify the calculation of your fee on our <a href="http://www.vidyalaya.us/dakhila">dakhila</a> portal.</p>


<p>Regards,</p>
