All students, grade 1 and above, would need to be assesed for proper placement in the Language class. Kindergarten 
students do not need assessment. We will try to schedule assessment once we have sufficient number of students. We hope to accept
all families depending on the availability of teacher volunteers. The confirmation emails will go out at the end of August when we
expect to get final confirmation of facilities from Board of Education.

<p>
Thank you for your interest in Vidyalaya,
