<p>Vidyalaya is organizing a meeting between the Trustees and the enrolled families. The objective of this meeting is to get a feedback from the family about their Vidyalaya experience and to offer them opportunity to volunteer make the organization more successful. </p>

<p>We would like to invite you to meeting immediately after prayers on <u>==DATE== at 10:00 AM</u>. The meeting will be held in room A1. When you enter the cafetorium and face the stage, there are stairs to your right in the back. Go up and room A1 is the first room on the left in the right corridor that leads to classrooms.</p>

<p>Volunteering is a mandatory requirement for participation in Vidyalaya and we look forward to meeting you. Please mark this date in your Calendar.</p>
