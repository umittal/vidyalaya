<p>
If there is a change in the family information, please let us know and we will generate a new package promptly. The volunteer registration process has been modified. We are expecting a set of codes to reduce the amount of paper we have to handle. Please expect to hear back from us by the end of August.

<p>We expect to move to Parsippany Hills High School Facilities. There is a healthy demand from community and we are inviting over 100 families to join the school. We want to share Vidyalaya with everyone who wants to be part of us. In order to balance the higher rental cost, fees will be raised to $450 for families with one child and $550  for families with two or more children. New students are being charged $50 registration fee starting this year and will be provided a bag, prayer book and prayer CD. Existing students can buy them <i>a la carte</i>. More information about fees is provided on the registration page and a presentation of finances will be made by trustees on June 12.

<p>Please note that we do not have a nurse or trained medical professional while the school is in session. An individual not feeling well is advised to stay at home and take rest. We also provide a snack at the end of the school day and those who are allergic to any specific ingredient are requested to be cognizant on their own and not take something that might cause an adverse reaction.
