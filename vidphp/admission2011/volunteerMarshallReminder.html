<p>We had sent you a request for a meeting with the Vidyalaya Trustees in December. We wanted to remind you that the meeting is immediately after prayers on <u>==DATE== at 10:00 AM</u>. The meeting will be held in room A1. When you enter the cafetorium and face the stage, there are stairs to your right in the back. Go up and room A1 is the first room on the left in the right corridor that leads to classrooms.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
