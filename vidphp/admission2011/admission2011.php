Please complete and mail your registration at the earliest. We will clear our wait list on June 5 and any request received after that will be assigned a new priority date. If you are not able to find your registration material, please let us know and we will send you the email again. If you have decided not to enroll this year for some reason, please do let us know so we can stop sending you reminders.

Please mail your application at the earliest so we can start working on putting the school together. If for some reason, you are unable to join, please let us know and we will stop sending you reminders. We hope to collect all remaining applications by June 5. It may be difficult to guarantee a spot after that.
