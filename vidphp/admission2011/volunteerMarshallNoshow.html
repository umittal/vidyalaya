<p>We were expecting to see you today and we missed you. We had a great meeting and we discussed how Vidyalaya works as an all-volunteer organization. We have the richest offering for our kids in the area and the tuition funds only the school activities. We also discussed why it is important to volunteer and the various opportunities available to contribute to the community.</p>

<p>Should you wish to attend another session, please let us know and we can reschedule any sunday this month. It is the obligation of each family to contribute 15 volunteer hours and we look forward to working with you for our shared objective.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Vidyalaya Administration <br />
