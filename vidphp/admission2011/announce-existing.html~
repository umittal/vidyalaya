The registration process for 2011-12 is now published at http://www.vidyalaya.us/modx/129. We look forward to seeing you all come back next year. Attached, please find a customized pdf consisting of your registration form, your family information as it exists in our database and a medical form for each child in the family. If there is  another potential student in the family, please let us know the name, date of birth, email and cell phone number. We will add it in our database and resend the customized email.

<p>
Please submit  registration form (one per family), medical form (one per student) and check (payable to Vidyalaya Inc.) by May 14, 2011. Please write your family id on the check. The volunteer registration has been reorganized for this year. Attached also find a pdf listing all volunteer teams and list the codes for the team in the registration form. We will contact everyone in the summer.

<p>We expect to move to Parsippany Hills High School Facilities. There is a healthy demand from community and we are inviting over 100 families to join the school. We want to share Vidyalaya with everyone who wants to be part of us. In order to balance the higher rental cost, fees will be raised to $450 for families with one child and $550  for families with two or more children. New students are being charged $50 registration fee starting this year and will be provided a bag, prayer book and prayer CD. Existing students can buy them <i>a la carte</i>. More information about fees is provided on the registration page and a presentation of finances will be made by trustees on June 12.

<p>Please note that we do not have a nurse or trained medical professional while the school is in session. An individual not feeling well is advised to stay at home and take rest. We also provide a snack at the end of the school day and those who are allergic to any specific ingredient are requested to be cognizant on their own and not take something that might cause an adverse reaction.
